What Is The Game?
</h2>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Each "game" consists of watching an episode of <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> and following a set of assigned episode-specific rules, ie) "Drink anytime 'this' or 'that' happens in the show" (all drinking rules refer to beer as the drink of choice unless otherwise specified).

What Are The Rules?
</h2>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Each "game" (each episode) has a number of unique, episode specific rules associated with it as well as two rules that overarch the entire series.

<h3 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">Episode Specific Rules:</h3>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
For each game, you are given two choices for how the rules you'll play with are picked. Your first choice is to select the number of rules you want to play with and have the program randomly select that many rules from that episode's rules roster for you. Your second choice is to view the rules roster and select exactly which rules you want to play with.

<h3 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">Two Overarching Rules:</h3>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 400px; text-align: left">
1) <em>Drink if you don't guess the episode title correctly before it's shown on screen.</em>
<br>
2) <em>Drink if the day or time seen on screen at the beginning of the episode matches the day or is within one hour of the time when you start watching the episode.</em>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
How Much Can I Expect To Drink?
</h2>

<h4 style="text-align: center">
It depends on how many rules you play with and how large your sips are. It should be noted that <em>on average</em>, <strong>one rule = 1/2 beer</strong>.
<br>
<strong>Remember that each game is one episode long which is (usually) only ~20 min so please use caution and know your limits when playing. Small sips are strongly recommended.
</strong>
<br>
There are also some special rules in a few episodes. These rules require alcoholic drinks other than beer (wine, liquor). You have the ability to toggle these special rules on or off as you please.
