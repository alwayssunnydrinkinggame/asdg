What Is The Game?
</h2>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Each "game" consists of watching an episode of <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> and following a set of assigned episode-specific rules, ie) "Drink anytime 'this' or 'that' happens in the show" (all drinking rules refer to beer as the drink of choice unless otherwise specified).

What Are The Rules?
</a>
</h2>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Each "game" (each episode) has a number of unique, episode specific rules associated with it as well as two rules that overarch the entire series.

<h3 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">Two Overarching Rules:</h3>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 20em; text-align: left">
1) <em>Drink if you don't guess the episode title correctly before it's shown on screen.</em>
<br>
2) <em>Drink if the day or time seen on screen at the beginning of the episode matches the day or is within one hour of the time when you start watching the episode.</em>

<h3 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">Episode Specific Rules:</h3>

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
For each game, choose a level of difficulty; this determines how many rules you want to play with. The level of difficulties are as follows:
</h4>
<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Easy ("I only drink socially")= 3 rules
</h4>
<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Medium ("I browned out that evening.") = 5 rules
</h4>
<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Hard ("I’m getting blackout drunk and you’re all leaving me alone.") = 7 rules
</h4>

<hr style="height:0px;border:none;visibility: hidden;" />

<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
It should be noted that <em>on average</em>, <strong>one rule = 1/2 beer</strong>.
</h4>
<h4 style="margin: 0px 150px; text-align: center">
Remember that each game is one episode long which is (usually) only ~20 min so please use caution and know your limits when playing. <strong>Small sips are strongly recommended.</strong>
<br>
There are also some special rules in a few episodes. These rules require alcoholic drinks other than beer (wine, liquor). Each special rule counts as THREE regular rules (factor this into the difficulty level you select).
